  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>Joseph Webber is a fantasy author from New Zealand who writes character-driven stories filled with heart, grit, and a touch of myth. His debut series, Toby the Monster Hunter, blends coming-of-age adventure with sword-and-sorcery action, following ordinary young heroes forced to rise far beyond the world they knew.

A lifelong storyteller and worldbuilder, Joseph draws inspiration from classic fantasy, competitive games, the landscapes he grew up in — both farm and city, and through travel. When he isn’t writing, he spends his time coaching badminton, building games in Unity, or expanding the sprawling lore behind his future books.

He believes in heroes who struggle, fail, get back up again — and in stories that leave readers wanting one more chapter.</p>
