<h3>Welcome to the Website (Finally Built It!)</h3>
<small>Posted: 19-11-2025</small>
<div><p>Welcome! You found my website — which means two things:</p>
<p>The domain name wasn’t already owned by a cryptocurrency startup, and<br>
I managed to wire the DNS settings correctly without accidentally deleting the internet.</p>
<p>Both are miracles.</p>

<p>This is the official home of my writing, book updates, and whatever else I decide to put here when procrastinating on actual chapters. If something looks broken, it was definitely intentional and part of my “minimalist aesthetic” (or Cloudflare did it — we blame them).</p>

<p>Here’s what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updates on current book progress</li>
  <li>Occasional behind-the-scenes notes from my writing cave</li>
  <li>Honest admissions that I’m behind schedule</li>
  <li>Maybe pictures of my cat (if I ever get one)</li>
  <li>Definitely no inspirational productivity advice because I have none</li>
</ul>

<p>In the meantime, feel free to look around, check out the books page, or send me a message through my shiny new author email — which hopefully forwards correctly and doesn’t disappear into a cosmic void.</p>

<p>Thanks for being here.<br>
It means a lot — and it makes all the late nights worth it.</p></div>
